#Tensorflow.js Transfer Learning Image Classifier Example

## Description

This example classifies images.

2. Take a pose or something that corresponds to each class of four (A to D) and press the `Train X` button.

3. If you have studied at least once, you can see `Prediction` and `Probability` at the bottom.

4. If the `Prediction` is not correct or the `Probability` is low, add more training data. (Step 2)

## Sample

* For A i created a tried to train with 1 finger
* For B i created a tried to train with 2 fingers
* For C i created a tried to train with 3 fingers
* For D i created a tried to train with 4 fingers


Please find the sample images in the repo for seults
